## Raw data ##
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
* README.txt
* features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* features.txt: List of all features.
* activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
* train/X_train.txt: Training set.
* train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
* test/X_test.txt: Test set.
* test/y_test.txt: Test labels.



## Processing Steps ##
* Read feature file
* get feature for mean and std
* read test data for mean and std
* read train data for mean and std
* merge data train and test data
* Changes colnames accordingly from feature.txt
* read activity data
* Describe activity accordingly based on activity_labels.txt
* group the dataset by subject and ativity and tally the average
